    <h3 class="assignment summary">10.3: Return of the Mexican</h3>
    <p>In Mexican, the score is based on two dice. Let's add some code that represents those two dice.
    	<ul>
    		<li>Add two buttons to the body. One for each die. </li>
    		<li>For each button, Make a corresponding function that is called when the button is clicked. </li>
    		<li>In both functions, generate a random number between 1 and 6 to simulate a die roll. Store the value in a global variable representing the corresponding die. Later on, we'll use those values to calculate the score.</li>
    		<li>Increase the currentTries variable by one whenever a die is clicked.</li>
    		<li>Finally, in the function, change the innerHTML of the button that was clicked to the generated number.</li>

    <h3 class="assignment summary">10.5: Mexican scoring</h3>
    <p>The calculateScore() function is not what it should be. Change it to accommodate the rules:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The function should return the score. Use the variables you created  </li>
        <li>When a 1 and a 2 are rolled, the score should be the maximum. (In javascript this is Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)</li>
        <li>When both dice rolls are the same (for example a 6 and a 6, or a 5 and a 5), the score should be that number times 100.</li>
        <li>When both dice rolls are different, but not 1 and 2, the score should be the dice rolls concatonated as a string, beginning with the highest one. (For example, a 3 and a 5 becomes 53. a 3 and a 2 becomes 32).</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Turn a number into a string using:</p>
<script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
    var a = 5
    var b = 3
    console.log( a + b ) // logs : 8
    console.log( a.toString() + b.toString() ) // logs : 53

    <section class="assignment">
    <h3 class="assignment summary">10.6: Mexican scumbag</h3>
    <p>Some edge cases in the rules should now be added to the script:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a user throws 31 (Scumbag), an alert should warn the user he has to take a drink. The user must rethrow both dices, it does not count as a try. </li>
        <li>If a user scores 21 (Mexican), the stakes (the number of shots) are increased by one. A player throwing a mexican never loses, he can always pass the turn to the next player, even if the previous player threw mexican as well. </li>
        <ul>
        	<li>Add a variable that represents the number of shots.</li>
        	<li>Add a div that shows the number of shots.</li>
        	<li>Make sure the next Player button can always be clicked when a 21 is thrown.</li>
        	<li>Add the logic where you see fit.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="assignment summary">10.7: Mexican double code</h3>
    <p>The amount of code used in this game can be greatly reduced by introducing some parameters or creating functions that group common functionality. In this example, the first approach (using parameters) is a bit tricky but introducing an extra function that eliminates double code can work wonders for the readability.</p>
    <p>In your code, commands that update the UI like <code>document.getElementById("currentTriesDiv").innerHTML =  3</code>, can probably be found all over the place. Make an "updateUI()" function where you place all these UI commands and call the function whenever you need to. </p>
