  <h1>Chapter 12: recap: let's review what you've learned by now</h1>

  <p>You've discovered quite a few new concepts, and some programming jargon. Most of these ideas are related and connected in some way. Now, would you like to read a long and abstract essay about the important programming concepts and their relations? If not, you're in luck. We are going to work with <i> concept maps</i> to do a recap and summarize of what you should understand by now. Concept maps are more visual, and a very effective notation for learning and communicating the main points of study material.</p>
  <h2>about concept maps for understanding stuff</h2>
  <p>Take a bit of time to understand why these concept maps are a good idea. Read at least the first two of these short articles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/conceptmap.php">What is a concept map?</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/howpeoplelearn.php">How people learn</a></li>
    <li><i>Optional, more in-depth:</i> <a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/docs/theory-of-concept-maps">Concept Maps and How to Construct and Use Them</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>recap of the past eleven chapters</h2>

  <div class="instruction">
    <p>You are going to create your own concept maps, and you will need the same software that was used in the video. It is called CMap Tools by the Florida Institute for Human & Machine Cognition.</p>
    <p><a href="https://cmap.ihmc.us/cmaptools/">Download it here.</a> Then install it.</p>
    <p>(There's also an iPad version, but we haven't tried it. And a "cloud" version you can use online. That one is way to simple to be useful, so skip it.)</p>
    <p>Also, download the concept map created in the video: <download href="./programming concept map.cxl"></download>. You add it to your CMAP installation by <i>importing it:</i></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure you have the "Views" window active. Activate it using the menu: <b>Window ▸ Show Views</b></li>
      <li>Now import it, also with the menu: <b>File ▸ Import ▸ CMap from CXL File…</b> </li>
    </ol>
    <hint steps=1>
      <hintstep buttontext="Show">Here are two short video's about using the Concept Map Tools App.</hintstep>
      <h4>Creating concepts</h4>
      <video controls="controls" width="580" name="Creating concepts" src="https://media.ihmc.us/videos/CmapTools%20-%20Creating%20Concepts%20and%20Propositions.mov"></video>
      <h4>Introduction to the Views Window</h4>
      <video controls="controls" width="580" name="Introduction to the Views Window" src="https://media.ihmc.us/videos/CmapTools%20-%20The%20Views%20Window.mov"></video>
  </hint>
<p>If you don't want to use the CMap Tools application, you can use any other drawing tool for the next assignments, like Illustrator, Powerpoint, pencil and paper, or (better yet) a whiteboard. You don't need to recreate the entire concept map. Just draw the new parts of the map, and if you need to connect to a concept in our map, just copy that concept to your drawing. To get you started, here's the concept map as a <download href="./programming-concept-map.png">PNG file</download>, and here it is as an <download href="./programming-concept-map.svg">SVG file.</download></p>

  <h3>12.1 another concept: parameters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add two concepts to the concept map: <b><i>parameters</i></b> and <b><i>arguments</i></b>.</li>
      <li>Connect the new concepts to the rest of the map. <i>What are the most important concepts to connect to?</i> You should be able to make at least four connections. Six is better.</li>
      <li>Give the connections meaningful labels. Think about the direction of the connection-arrow.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="instruction">
      <p>To send in your work, create a JPEG or a PNG image from your concept map, and mail the image.</p>
      <p>Use the menu: <b>File ▸ Export CMap As ▸ Image File…</b>, then choose JPEG or PNG as the file format, and save.</p>

    <h3>12.2 side effects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a connection between the concept <i>side effect</i> and either <i>local variable</i> or <i>global variable</i>. Which one do you choose? Give the connection an informative label.</li>
      <li>Add two more examples of side effects, that are specific to JavaScript, to the concept map. Can you think of Javascript side-effects that are not about changing the web page?</li>
      <li>Add one more example of a side effect that is specific to Arduino. Can you think of Arduino side effects that are not about changing an output pin?</li>

    <p>Add the four most important datatypes to the concept map.</p>

    <h3>12.4 more about operators</h3>
    <p>There is just a single concept for <i>operator</i> on the map.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a connection that starts at <i>operator</i>, and points to <i>value</i>. What is the best label for that connection?</li>
      <li>create the reverse connection: from <i>value</i> to <i>operator</i>. What is the best label for that connection? Feel free to revise the label for the other connection. They have to make sense <i>together</i>.</li>
      <li>add concepts for the <i>three important families of operators</i>, and add two examples of each family.</li>
      <li>can you create some (say 3 or 4) connections from these operator families to other parts of the concept map?</li>

    <h3>12.5 knowing when to quit</h3>
    <p>The video focuses on when JavaScript or Arduino programs <i>start</i>. But:</p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>In what circumstances does an Arduino program stop? Name them all.</li>
      <li>In what circumstances does JavaScript code stop? Name at least four different situations.</li>
