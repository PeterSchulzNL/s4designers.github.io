  <h1>16: final task JavaScript: Battleships</h1>
  
  <p>In this final task for JavaScript, you are going to create an online version of the popular boardgame <i>battleships</i>. For those unfamiliar with the game, below is a detailed video about the game.</p>
  <youtube ytid="q0qpQ8doUp8"></youtube>
    <p>
    To get you started we created a sort-of-working version of the game. It's a working program, but much functionality is missing: Boats can only be placed horizontally, there is no way to know who has won and the computer is playing like an idiot. You get the idea: you are going to improve this game.  Download the file, open it in a browser and play around with it. In assignment 1, we are going to explore the code. 
    </p>

    <h4>how to get a passing grade</h4>  
    Grading is very simple. Each of the assignments on this page can earn you up to 1 point. Finish them all, with high quality code, and you will receive a 10. You need 5.5 points to pass. Your program should not display any errors in the console.

    <h4 id="isas">iSAS</h4>
    <p>If you're not an Academy for IT and Media Design regular, you may not be familiar with <a href="https://isas.han.nl">iSAS</a>. iSAS is (one of) our information system(s), and you have to use it to upload all the work you did for this course. We are legally oblidged to keep an archive of all the work that students recieve credits for. You don't have to upload your work right away. The deadline is 7&frac12; weeks after the start of the course. Use your HAN-account to <a href="https://isas.han.nl">log&nbsp;in&nbsp;to&nbsp;iSAS</a>. iSAS will tell you the exact date for the deadline.</p>
    <p>After logging in, you'll find that iSAS wants you to upload four things, with unfamiliar names. That is because the information structure in iSAS has not been updated to reflect the current structure of the course (it's also not in English). Here's what you have to upload:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>iSAS name</th><th>what to upload</th>

  <h3>16.1: exploration</h3>
  <section class="assignment">
  <p>This assignment asks some questions about the code. Answering them will help you get a feel for what is going on.</p>
  <ol type="text">
    <li>Which code is executed when the program starts?</li>
    <li>Which code is executed when something is clicked?</li>
    <li>What does the <code>createMySea()</code> function do?</li>
    <li>After the program starts. How many elements are there in the <code>mySquares</code> array?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between a square on the canvas and a square in the mySquares array?</li>
    <li>What does the <code>createFriendlyGridSquare()</code> function do?</li>
    <li>What does the <code>changeSquareStateAndRedraw()</code> function do? Try to get it to do something by calling it (with the proper arguments) in the console.</li>
    <li>When is the <code>gameSetupRound()</code> function called? What does the parameter do?</li>  
    <li>When is the <code>playRound()</code> function called?</li>

  <h3>16.2: hints</h3>
  <p>The game is a bit confusing for the user. Make sure there always is a hint on the screen telling the user what to do.</p>
  <p><i>Example hints: </i> </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Place boat of length 3.</li>
    <li>Throw bomb in enemy sea.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>16.3: random boat placement</h3>
  <p>The enemy now places its boats in the same location every time because the array containing the enemy boats is a given. Delete the contents of this array and write code that generates a similar array, with only water in it. Then add code to place enemy ships in the enemySea randomly, and draw the enemy sea on the screen. </p>
  <p>For placing the boats, make sure the boats are placed in a valid position. 
  <ul>
    <li>What are the two ways that a boat placement could be not valid?</li>
    <li>Maybe you can reuse some functions?</li>
  </ul> 
  
  <h3>16.4: ships have names.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The hint saying "place boat of length 3" is a bit boring. We want it to say "Place Aircraft Carrier of length 5".</li>
      <li>The <code>ships</code> array currently contains only the length of each ship. Modify it to hold objects containing two properties: the name of the ship, and its length. Make sure the rest of the code keeps working now, that you've changed an important data structure.</li>
      <li>When placing a boat, make sure that the name of the boat is also stored in each square containing a segment of the boat. Also store this name in the squares where the enemy places its boats.</li>
      <li>Whenever a bomb is thrown and hits a ship, check and see whether the sea still contains any square with the same name that isn't hit yet. Use this information to show the user which boats have already been sunk and which have not. </li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
  <div class="instruction">
    <p>Some assignments are more difficult than others. You don't need to finish all of them. From this point forward, each assignment can be done independently of each other. Take your time to read all of them now. Try to guess which ones are hard and which ones are easy. Do the ones you think are easy first.</p>
    <p>The further you get, the more complex your code gets. You may need to modify code of earlier assignments in order to get others to work.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>16.5: double</h3>
  <p>Both the computer and the human player can throw bombs at the same location twice. Modify the game to prevent this from happening.</p>

  <h3>16.6: vertical</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a button to the interface. The player should be able to use this button while placing boats to toggle between placing boats vertically and horizontally.</li>
    <li>Write code that allows a player (and the computer) to place boats horizontally. Make sure boats are only placed on valid positions. (They should not overlap and should respect the borders of the sea).</li>
  </ul>

<h3>16.7: winner</h3>
 <p> The game should notify the player when there is a winner and who won.</p>

<h3>16.8: canvas</h3>
 <p> Whenever a player drops a bomb, the game should not only change the color of the square, it should also:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Draw a cross through the square when a player misses.</li>
   <li>Draw a circle in the centre of the square when a player hits a boat.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>16.9: AI</h3>
 <p> The current enemy is an idiot. He throws bombs at random. Make the computer more intelligent.</p>

<h3>16.10: refactor</h3>
 <p>While programming, it is not uncommon for functionality of elements in your to change a bit. This can be a problem for the readability of your code if you did not carefully think about renaming the affected functions and variables whilest making your change. This assignment is about cleaning up your final code to make it more readable and more intelligent. Follow the steps and refactor your code before handing it in. Refactoring is the proces of looking back on working code and making it better.</p>

<div class="hint-content">Backup your code before proceeding!</div>
 <ul>
   <li>Do all variables contain whatever their names suggest? If not, change the name.</li>
   <li>Do functions do whatever their names suggest? If not, change their names.</li>
   <li>Can you guess whether or not a function has a return or a side-effect based on the name alone?</li>
   <li>Can you guess the (return) type of each variable and function?</li>
   <li>Can you use a function to deduplicate similar looking code?</li>
   <li>Do you have similar looking functions? Can you use a parameter to make the code more flexible?</li>
   <li>Is the flow of your program clear in a story like function like (<code>playRound()</code>, or <code>gameSetupRound()</code>)?</li>
   <li>Are there functions in your code that are nolonger used?</li>
  <li>Do comments still describe the code they are commenting about?</li>
 </ul>

 <h3>16.11: <span class="inline-bonus">BONUS:</span>multiplayer battleships</h3>
  <p> Use Firebase (or any other technology) to make your battleships implementation work online against another player. The option to play the computer should still be available.</p>
