  <h1>Chapter 5: russian dolls for data: variables <i>inside</i> variables</h1>
  <p>This chapter introduces two ways of combining multiple variables into <i>data structures</i>: <b>objects</b> and <b>arrays</b>. Such data structures allow you to store many pieces of information in a single variable. Later chapters will also use arrays and objects.</p>

        <img src="dolls.jpg" style="width:200px; float:right">
        <i>Nesting</i> things means placing things of a certain kind inside other things of the same kind. It is how the folders on your harddisk are organized. The elements of an HTML page are also placed inside other elements. Nesting very common in programming languages. One example you've seen is the nesting of expressions:<p>
          <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript"> abs( initialMagnetValue - analogRead(MAGNETSENSOR) )</script>
          <p>This entire piece of code is an expression: it creates a value. It also <i>contains</i> smaller epressions, such as MAGNETSENSOR, analogRead(MAGNETSENSOR) and the substraction.</p>
        </p>This exercise introduces you to placing objects inside objects: 
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
var player = {
  name: "Conan",
  stats: {
  	strength: 80,
  	intelligence: 30,
  	personality: 50
  },
  weapon: {
  	name: "Sword of Endless Fury",
  	damage: "3d5",
  	attack: "2d3 + 15"
  },
  class: "Warrior",
  race: "Barbarian"
}
// add your code here
      </script>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Write the name of the player to the console (using the object)</li>
        <li>Write the strength of the player to the console (using the object)</li>
        <li>Change the name of the sword to "Axe of the Destroyer".</li>
        <li>Conan is a good guy. Add an "alignment" property with value "Good"</li>

        The code above is a bit confusing. What belongs with what? Organise the code by grouping the vairables into any number of objects. Give the object variables meaningful titles.

      <p>
        A variable can contain an array as its value. A property of an object can also contain an array as its value. Suppose the four spells are the spells Luna knows. Add an array of spells to the "spells" property of luna. 
      </p>

        <i>If you are succesfull, the following code would work to access the first spell: console.log(wizard.spells[0]), where wizard is the name of the variable containing the object.</i>
