  <h3 class="assignment questions">9.2.b: Point of one return</h3>  
  It is usually nicer if a function has just one single return-statement. Can you rewrite the code to work exactly the same way, but uses a variable to replace the 4 return-statements with a single one?

      <h3 class="assignment questions">9.6: Mexican</h3>
      <p>Mexican is a popular drinking game which is usually called "mex-en" in Dutch. We are going to make an online version. The <a href="https://www.webtender.com/handbook/games/mexican.game">rules</a> are a bit complicated.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The game is played with two or more people.</li>
        <li>The game is played with two dice.</li>
        <li>A player first throws 2 dice. This results in a score (the scoring is explained later).</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the player is happy with his score, the player passes the turn to the next player.</li>
          <li>If the player is unhappy with his score, the player can throw one, or both the dice again. </li>
          <li>The maximum number of tries is 3. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The next player now tries to better the previous player's score. He can use as many tries as the first player used.</li>
        <li>The first player that can't better the previous player's score loses (and drinks a number of shots that is dependent on some factors).</li>
        <li>If the last player did not lose, the game continues with the first player.</li>
      </ul>

}
 document.getElementById("rollBothButton").onclick = rollBothDice
 document.getElementById("nextPlayerButton").onclick = nextPlayer
 
 &lt;/script>
</body>
</html>
  </script>
  <p>The code above provides a starting point for our program. Note that, for now, the complicated scoring system is simplified with a random number generator. Give the code a try. Also note, the singular for dice is die (some students find this confusing).  </p>
  <p>Add code to the nextPlayer() function in such a way that if the currentScore is higher than the score in the scoreToBeat variable, scoreToBeat is updated.</p>

     <script type="text/plain" class="language-javascript">
      document.getElementById("nextPlayerButton").disabled = true // this code disables the nextPlayerButton
     </script>

  <p>Change the rollBoth() function in such a way that when the currentScore is higher than the scoreToBeat variable, the nextPlayerButton is enabled, but that the button is disabled in all other cases. </p>

  <section class="assignment">
      <h3 class="assignment questions">9.8: Mexican limit</h3>
  <p>Players cannot try more than the original number of tries. Change the rollBoth() function in such a way that the currentTries is more than or the same as the maximumNumberOfTries, the rollBothButton is disabled. Note that the maxNumberOfTries variable starts at 3 for the first player</p>
   <p>When you are done with this step, the game should sort of work. You cannot continue to the next player unless you have more than the previous player. You cannot throw more dice than the first player did. Whoever loses should not have any button to click. In the next chapter, the scoring system is going to be build. </p>
