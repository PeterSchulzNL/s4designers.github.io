  <h3>15.2: your first method</h3>
  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.2.a: salut!</h4>
  <p>15.2Take this code, and give the object a method that calculates a proper salutation for the person:</p>
  <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
    function createPerson( firstName, lastName, gender, title) {
      return { firstName: firstName, 
               lastName: lastName, 
               gender: gender, 
               title: title 
             }
    }

    var person1 = createPerson('Harry', 'Potter', 'male', null )  // null used to specify no title
    console.log( person1.sulutation() )  // => "Mr."
    var person2 = createPerson('Petunia', 'Dursley', 'female', null ) 
    console.log( person2.sulutation() )  // => "Mrs."
    var person3 = createPerson('Minerva', 'McGonagall', 'female', 'professor' )
    console.log( person3.sulutation() )  // => "professor"
    var person4 = createPerson('Tinky', 'Winky', 'other', null )
    console.log( person4.sulutation() )  // => "Mx."                // see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mx_(title)
  </script>
  <ul>
    <li>If the person has a title (title is not null or undefined), the title is the salutation</li>
    <li>Otherwise: "Mr." for male persons, "Mrs." for female persons, and "Mx." for people who are neither male or female.</li>
  </ul>

  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.2.b: 'nother method</h4>
  <p>Add to the same objects a method called <code>toString()</code>, that returns a string containing the salutation and the first name and last name. Also write some code to test the method.</p>
  <answer buttontext="mail your code"></answer>
  </section>

  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.2.c: toString() is special</h4>
  <p>Try this in the console:</p>

    var person4 = createPerson('Tinky', 'Winky', 'other', null )
    alert( "I always watch " + person4 + " on television!")

  <h3>15.3: new methods for old squares</h3>
  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.3.a: stop the show!</h4>
  <p>Download the final code for the moving squares from the video: <download href="./methodsOnCanvas-v2.html"></download></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add a method to the square-objects that make them stop moving.</li>
    <li>Add a button to the HTML that stops both buttons by calling your method.</li>
  </ul> 
  <answer buttontext="mail your code"></answer>
  </section>

  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.3.b: </h4>
  <p>Replace the old function <code>startAnimation()</code>with the following code:</p>
  <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
    function startAnimation() {
      setInterval( doAnimationStep, 40) // 40 ms = 25 frames per second
      // After the animation has started, a click on the canvas should 
      // be handled differently:
      canvasElement.onclick = handleCanvasClick
    }
    canvasElement.onclick = startAnimation
    
    function handleCanvasClick(eventInfo) {
      // Check if a square is hit by the nouse click.If so, call
      // a method on the square to respond to the click.
      // eventInfo.offsetX and eventInfo.offsetY give the canvas 
      // coordinates of the mouse click.

      if(squareOne.hitTest(eventInfo.offsetX, eventInfo.offsetY)) {
        squareOne.onclick()
      }
      if(squareTwo.hitTest(eventInfo.offsetX, eventInfo.offsetY)) {
        squareTwo.onclick()
      }
    }
    
    function hitTestSquare(mouseX,mouseY) {
      // test if mouse coordinates are inside the square
      var fitsHorizontally = mouseX >= this.x && mouseX < this.x+this.size
      var fitsVertically = mouseY >= this.y && mouseY < this.y+this.size
      return fitsHorizontally && fitsVertically
    } 
  </script>
  <p>This code allows the user to click inside the canvas, when the animation is running. Read the comments, and try to understand how it works.</p>
  <p>The code is missing two methods in the square-objects. That is your job:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Determine what the names are for the methods that must exist in the square objects.</li>
    <li>We want each square to stop moving when it is clicked. The other one should keep moving (if it wasn't already stopped).</li>
    <li>Add the two methods. You probably won't have to write new functions for this, but if you feel that you do: that's fine, go ahead.</li>

  <h2>polymorphism: objects do it their way</h2>
  <youtube ytid="coePwuUOySg"></youtube>
  <p>What are methods good for? It turns out that you can organize large programs very well by <b>hiding variation inside objects</b>. Take a game, for example: all the NPCs (non-player characters) can move, make sound, respond to the player etc. They all have to be able to do these things, but each kind of NPC should be allowed to do them differently from the other types of NPC. Using methods you can package this variation within the code for the NPC objects. The rest of the program only has to understand that it can <i>simply ask these objects</i> to move, play sound or respond. The rest of the game code doesn't have to have any code that deals with the differences between NPC types.</p>

  <h3>15.9: warming up</h3>
  <p>Here's a list of different types of animals, and a function:</p>
  <script type="text/plain" class="language-js">
    var animalFarm = [
      { name: "Bessie",
        type: "pig",
        toString: function() { return this.name + " the " + this.type }
      },
      { name: "Rufus",

        type: "cat",
        toString: function() { return this.name + " the " + this.type }

    function animalMakeNoise(animal) {

      alert( animal.name + ' says "' + theNoise + '"')
      console.log( animal + ' says "' + theNoise + '"')
    }
  </script>

  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.8.a: cacophony</h4>
  <p>Add some code that make noise for every animal in the list. Your code should work with both short and long lists of dogs, cats, pigs and ducks.</p>
  <p>Compare the strings that are sent to the <code>alert()</code> command to the output on the console. Explain the output on the console.</p>
  <answer buttontext="mail your both the code, and your explanation"></answer>
  </section>
  
  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.8.b: method time</h4>
  <p>Give each animal a second method. The new method should do what the animalMakeNoise function does, but just for that animal object. Also, skip the <code>alert()</code>; it is OK to just output to the console.</p>
  <p>Adapt the code you wrote in the previous exercise to work with the method instead of the function.</p>
  <p>The result should be a program that does exactly the same thing (except for the alerts). This is called a <i>refactoring</i>. Refactorings should not change what the code does, but they are intended to make the program simpler. Do you think that this refactored code is more, or less complicated than the code before?</p>

  <p>This version has two differences:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>There are items that are ads.</b><br>
      They should just show their image, but if you click on them, the browser should open the webpage given in the <code>url:</code> property. In HTML, you create a clickable image using code like this:
      <script type="text/plain" class="language-html">
        <a href="url-for-when-image-is-clicked"><img src="url-for-image-itself"></a>
      </script>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Some songs now have an extra property called <code>youtubeId:</code>.</b><br>
      Items with such a property should have a title that is clickable (using the &lt;a href="&hellip;"&gt; tag), and will navigate the browser to the Youtube page for that video. Complete urls for Youtube video's can be created from the youtube-id like this:
      <code>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=</code><i><code>the-youtube-id</code></i>.<br>
      Songs that do not have a youtubeId should not have a clickable title.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We want all items to appear in the webpage. Our old render function, and the old song template aren't enough enymore. We need extra template(s), and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;extra render functions.</p>
  <p>Solve the problem using polymorphism: using objects that store different functions under the same property name. </p>
  <p>Before you start programming, make a decision: Will you use&hellip;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&hellip;<i>a single render function for the render method?</i></li>
    <li>&hellip;<i>two different functions for the render method</i> (e.g. one for ads, and one for songs)? Or&hellip;</li>
    <li>&hellip;<i>three different functions for the render method</i>? (one for ads, one for songs <i>with</i> a <code>youtubeId</code>, and one for songs <i>without</i> one)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use a for loop to add a method called "render" to each item in the list. The render methods use your template function to generate the proper HTML, given the type of object that they are part of.</p>
  <p>Rewrite the code that generates HTML for the entire playlist to call the method, instead of the stand-alone render function you had before. Your program should, of course, execute the "method installer" function before it starts rendering the page.</p>

  <h3>15.10 polymorphic squares</h3>
  <p>Here is the code from the last video. <download href="./methodsOnCanvas-v4.html"></download> It has the looping over the array for animating many squares, and it has a bit of polymorphism in the behavior of the squares (i.e. the <code>update()</code> method). What is <i>doesn't</i> have is the interactivity that you created in exercise 15.3.</p>
  
  <section class="assignment">
  <h4>15.10.a: combining code</h4>
  <p>Look at the code for doing the interactivity in your 15.3 solution. (Or, if you weren't happy about that solution: create a new one). Then change the code from the last video (i.e. from the download above) to also support the same interactivity: <b>When any of the squares is clicked, (regardless of its type) it should stop animating</b>. The rest should continue.</p>
  <p>Among other tasks, you will have to change the function <code>handleCanvasClick()</code>, that was given in 15.3, to deal with many squares that are inside an array. But that is something you've done before :-)</p>
  <p><span class="inline-note">TIP:</span>If you find that it is difficult to actually click on the moving squares, there are two things you can do: It would certainly work if you slow down the entire animation. But it might also work if, instead of reacting to the 'onclick' event on the canvas, you listened to the 'onmousedown' event. That one doesn't wait for the user to release the mouse button.</p>

  <h4>15.10.b: let's get wild!</h4>
  <p>Instead of stopping the squares, make them do fun stuff. Like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>changing direction</li>
    <li>start moving in a (random) diagonal direction.<br> (just give it <i>both</i> an <code>xSpeed</code> and a <code>ySpeed</code>, and update them both)</li>
    <li>simply becoming 10% bigger with each click</li>
    <li>start rotating. <br> (in the code you downloaded, we changed the <code>drawSquare()</code> function to be able to draw rotated squares. All you have to do is give your square a property called 'angle' with a number in it. See the comments in the code).</li>
    <li>start going faster or slower</li>
    <li>taking a new, random, color</li>
    <li>adding <i>another square</i> to the field that starts on the same position, but moves in a different direction.</li>
    <li><span class="inline-bonus">BONUS:</span>add a lot of tiny squares (use a for-loop) to the field, each with a different diagonal direction and a bright color.<br> You could increase the opacity of the tiny squares slowly (or quickly) to make them "fade out" (the new <code>drawSquare()</code> can also deal with opacity in the color of a square). You could then reuse the gravity code (used with the orange squares) for the tiny squares, making them do down after going up.<br>These tricks together might make it look like there are fireworks going off! That would be a proper celebration of the end of this programming course.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>One requirement, though: <b>Each of the three families of squares (small dark blue, big light blue, and orange) must have different behaviour</b> when you click them. All squares of the same family must have the same behavior. </p>
